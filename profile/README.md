## Ode

Ode is a platform focused on making classical, contemporary, and performing arts more accessible and discoverable. We build tools that help audiences find meaningful cultural experiences, and help organizations reach new and existing patrons with clarity and care.

This GitHub organization contains the core infrastructure, services, and internal tooling that power Ode across web, editorial, and partner-facing surfaces.

### What lives here

Repositories in this organization may include:

- Core application code (APIs, services, web clients)
- Internal tools and admin systems
- Infrastructure and deployment workflows
- Experiments and prototypes related to discovery, curation, and editorial tooling

Not all repositories are public-facing products. Some are exploratory or internal by design.

### Engineering principles

Our work is guided by a few consistent principles:

- Human-centered systems over feature density
- Clarity over cleverness
- Reliability and observability as first-class concerns
- Design treated as part of system architecture, not a layer on top

We value small, understandable components that compose well over large, opaque abstractions.

### Contributions

At this time, most repositories are developed by a small internal team.

If a repository explicitly welcomes issues or pull requests, contribution guidelines will be documented in that repository. For everything else, please assume the code is not open for external contribution unless stated otherwise.

### Documentation

Project-specific documentation lives alongside the code in each repository. Shared conventions, patterns, and workflows are documented where relevant rather than centralized prematurely.

### Contact

For repository-specific questions, open an issue if the repository allows it.
